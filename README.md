# jamming

This is the final project from Codecademy's React course.

Jamming allows you to search for songs, add them to a playlist, and then save that playlist to your Spotify. It uses the Spotify's API.

To make it work, first you'll need to 'create an app' on Spotify's developers dashboard to get an Client ID.
Then, you can paste it on src > util > Spotify.js on the "clientId" variable.
